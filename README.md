Hello, my name's William and I'm a student from Sweden. Currently I'm a newbie at porgramming, however I'm trying to learn and if anyone would wanna help me develop apps or website, then you can write an email to me(email is at the bottom)

I'm gonna use github for my projects which I make in school or at home, all of my repos will be free to use for anyone, I would be happy if you'd even wanna use any of it, I encourage the usage of my repos.
